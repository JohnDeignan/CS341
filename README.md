# CS341
This course provides an introduction to automata theory, computability theory, and complexity theory. Theoretical models such 
as finite state machines, push-down stack machines, and Turing machines are developed and related to issues in programming 
language theory. Also, the course covers undecidability and complexity theory, including the classes P and NP.
